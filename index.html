<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> While in college for business, I quickly realized that a degree alone would not make me a business owner. That led to me starting a mobile dog grooming business. I quickly realized 90% of my business came from an application called Thumbtack. I thought about all the ways it could be optimized however at the time I believed I would never be able to understand computers much less create a web application. I eventually needed a website and looked for youtube videos to guide me, I realized through watching these videos that it wasn't as difficult as I had feared. So i created my first site and began my research. I watched Harvard computer science lectures online and began learning Swift and Python. Overwhelmed with all the possibilties I looked into data science and began attempting to learn Kaggle projects. After exploring I still felt as though full stack developing was my passion. I then built a shopify site for our diesel performance business and decided it was time for me to go into a formal program. It has already proven that I will have plenty of like minded individuals to work with. </p>
<p> In my free time I train for marathons, fish and I am always taking my dogs on new adventures. We have a special place in our hearts for Destin, FL but thats also because neither the fish or the water is that great here on the Texas coast!</p>
